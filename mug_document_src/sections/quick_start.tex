\section{Quick start}
\subsection{Overview}

The C3S2 311 Lot 1 - Global Land and Marine Observations Database (GLAMOD) service provides access to in situ surface observations from various climate archives in a common data model.
This document describes the marine component of the service, providing access to surface marine meteorological observations.
This component is currently based on Release 3.0 and Release 3.0.2 of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS, \cite{Freeman2017,Liu2022}).
Starting with release 7, we include reprocessed drifting buoy data provided by the C-RAID project (\cite{craid202404}) as an additional input data source.

The input data has been enhanced by: 
\begin{itemize}
\item advanced quality control tests; 
\item enhanced duplicate detection and flagging; 
\item association of instrumental metadata with the observations. 
\end{itemize}

The observations in ICOADS come from a range of observing platforms, before 1980 these are primarily ships but with an increasing number of measurements made by sensors installed on moored and drifting buoys after this date. 
The ship observations are clustered over the shipping routes prevalent at the time of observation. 
Coverage by drifting buoys tends to be more dispersed but with lower sampling over regions of ocean upwelling. 
Moored buoy data, with the exception of the tropical arrays, tend to be more coastal and concentrated around North America and Europe.

Each meteorological report in ICOADS contains observations of multiple Essential Climate Variables (ECVs, e.g. \cite{Bojinski2014}) made at the same time and location, for example coincident measurements of the air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, sea surface temperature and sea level pressure.
From the mid 2000s the record is dominated by reports from drifting buoys but these only report a small subset of the ECVs included in this service, typically only sea level pressure or sea surface temperature.
From 2015 onwards drifting buoy data from C-RAID complements the near real-time ship data from ICOADS 3.0.2. The C-RAID dataset contains fully reprocessed and scientifically checked data and metadata of about 20,000 drifting buoys since 1979.
Inclusion of the full C-RAID data set into this service is planned for future releases.

The reporting frequency ranges from hourly or more frequent in the recent period to daily observations prior to \sim 1860. 
In the intervening period observing frequency ranged from three times per day based on the watches on board ships to 3-hourly or 6-hourly observations. 

Several sources of metadata have been used, for the period after \sim 1982 metadata from WMO-No. 47, the "List of Selected, Supplementary and Auxilary Ships" (e.g. \cite{Kent2007}) has been merged with the ship observations.
Some ships observations prior to 1982 have also been merged with the WMO-No. 47 metadata but this is hampered by a lack of ship callsigns within the data before this date.
Additional metadata has been extracted from the ICOADS Supplemental Data (see \cite{Freeman2017}) and documentation available on the ICOADS website.

The C-RAID drifting buoy data set contains metadata that has been merged from sources provided by the NOAA AOML Global Drifter Program and the satellite service provider CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites) (see \cite{craid202404activity} for details). 
Metadata included in the C-RAID data set has been merged into this data product, where applicable.


Apart from the summary information presented in this document, a detailed overview of the data contents for each of the input sources is available in the Marine Data Inventory \\
(\inventoryref{}).

\subsection{Essential Climate Variables and observing methods}

Table \ref{tab:ecvs} lists the Essential Climate Variables included in the current release. 
Table \ref{tab:ecvs} also summarises the principle observing methods and changes over time for those ECVs.
Early observations (< 1950s) were typically recorded in whole units, for example whole degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on national practice.
In some cases the data were recorded to higher precisions but truncated or rounded when digitised (e.g. \cite{Chan2019}) or shared operationally. 
This rounding for operational data streams persisted until the 1980s (e.g. \cite{Willett2008}).
Later observations were typically recorded and shared with precisions of tenths or higher.
As part of the processing to create ICOADS (and earlier datasets) the observations were converted to standardised units (°C for temperatures, hPa for pressure and m/s for speeds) and uniform resolution, typically to one or two decimal places.
These have been further processed as part of the GLAMOD service and fully converted to S.I. units.
Where recorded, the originally reported value and units of the observations can be traced back to the original input data.
There are known issues with the marine meteorological observations, these are discussed further in Section \ref{data_sources}.
No corrections or adjustments have been applied as part of this service, instead the user is directed to the literature identified within Section \ref{data_sources}.

\subsection{Coverage}
The temporal coverage of the data available in the current release spans the period \datatimerange{}, Figure \ref{fig:ecv_ts1} shows the coverage per ECV. 
Before the Brussels International Maritime Conference of 1853 the most common ECVs to be reported were: air temperature; wind speed / force and direction; and sea level pressure, with typically \sim 100 - 200 observations per month. 
A small number of sea surface temperature and humidity observations are available (< 100).
Following the Brussels conference there is a large increase in number of observations to O(10,000) per month for all parameters excluding dew point temperature. 
Dew point observations only reach 10,000 per month on a routine basis around the time of the First World War.
For all parameters, the number of observations increases over time to around 100,000 per month in the 1960s and remains at this level until the 1990s.
From the mid 1990's there is a large increase in the number of sea level pressure and sea surface temperature observations from drifting buoys.
The C-RAID drifting buoy data record currently ends in early 2019, resulting in a drop in the number of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure observations.

    \label{fig:ecv_ts1}
%\end{center}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:nreports-map1} shows the total number of reports and total number of months per 1x1 degree grid cell, however over the period \datatimerange{} there have been major changes to the spatial sampling.
Early in the record there were typically a few hundred 1x1 degree grid cells with data per month (see Figure \ref{fig:ecv_ts1}).
These tended to be concentrated in the Atlantic Ocean and around the southern capes to the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
With the opening of the Suez and then Panama canals the major shipping routes changed, with less shipping transiting the capes and a greater proportion transiting the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas to reach the Indian and Pacific oceans.

Spatial coverage reached a peak between the 1960s and 1990s but declined sharply after 1990.
The number of grid cells dropped from around 20,000 to around 10,000 - 12,000 by 2020 for the majority of parameters. 
The contrast between the stable number of observations and decreasing spatial coverage (contrasting red and black lines in Figure \ref{fig:ecv_ts1}) is due to the change in reporting frequency from 6 hourly to 3 or 1 hourly and greater over the past 30 years, increasing the temporal sampling at the cost of spatial sampling.
Sea level pressure and sea surface temperature experience a much smaller marked decline in spatial coverage due to the contribution of drifting buoys.

%It should be noted that observations for the period 1784 - 1850 were also processed as part of this release but due to missing time information and the sparseness of the data neither the quality control nor duplicate detection software has been run for this period. These data are available by selecting the "all data" option when downloading but should be used with caution.

The GLAMOD dataset can be downloaded and accessed via the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS):
\begin{center}
\sloppy\url{https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/insitu-observations-surface-marine?tab=overview}.
 \end{center}
Through the service you have the possibility to subset the data e.g. by variable, time and domain.
Another possibility to download and process the data is using the CDS Python API:
 \url{https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api}) 

A detailed description on data access and how to download the data is given in section \ref{sec:data_access} of this document.


\subsection{Data model}
\label{subsection:data_model}
Data from the Climate Data Store are returned in delimited text files (.csv), with 19 columns per row and one observed value per row. 
The columns are listed in table \ref{tab:cdm_lite} together with a brief description.  
The date and time of the observation is given by the \code{date\_time} column, with the value returned as a string of the format \code{YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss}. 
All data are returned in the UTC time zone.
The location of the observation is given by the \code{latitude} and \code{longitude} columns in the WGS84 / EPSG4326 coordinate reference system. 
The variable being reported / observed is given by the \code{observed\_variable} column, the units by the \code{units} column and the observed value by the \code{observation\_value} column. 
The remaining columns provide further contextual information for the observations, such as platform type and station identifiers etc. 
%A number of the columns are enumerated using code tables, indicated by the text \code{(coded)} in the Kind column of Table \ref{tab:cdm_lite}.
%These code tables are reproduced in tables \ref{tab:report_type} to \ref{tab:licence} but with only those values used in the marine data listed.
