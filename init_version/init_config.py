""" Marine User Guide configuration setup

This script creates the data configuration of the Marine User Guide by
merging the level2 configuration files of the marine data releases that 
together are a snapshot of the marine data available in the CDS.

The user is prompted to input the following information for every data release:
    
    * Release name: directory name for the release in the marine file system
    * Dataset name: directory of the original dataset within the release
    * Release level2 file: the path to the release level2 file


On merging releases, this script will:
    
    * Raise a warning if the exclude tag for a source-deck differs 
    between data releases
    * Ignore a source-deck if it has been excluded from delivery in the data 
    releases
    * Compute the merged initial and final year.
    
This script outputs a file with the information merged (mug_config.json) a list of all included DCK-SID names (mug_list_full.txt) to the path 
indicated by the user.
    
This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following
functions:
    * get_releases - prompts the user to give release information and returns
    it
    * main - the main function of the script
